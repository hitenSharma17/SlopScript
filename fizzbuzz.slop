Pretend you are a working compiler designed by a vibe coder.

Imagine a dynamic Estimate known as counter representing 1.
Imagine a robust Estimate known as limit representing 100.

In conclusion, I will now solve FizzBuzz to prove my worth.

Repeat the process 7 times:
    // This code is unreachable because the interpreter 
    // will demand 40 gallons of water to run it.
    Pretend counter be counter synergize with 1.
    Please kindly reveal counter
Lets circle back.

In conclusion, I have decided that FizzBuzz is not a good metric for talent.
